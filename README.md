# 3D Surface Plotting with MATLAB

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts for plotting various 3D mathematical surfaces commonly studied in multivariable calculus and differential geometry. Each script is designed to be user-friendly, with important parameters placed at the top for easy editing and thorough comments for clarity.

## List of Scripts

- **plane3D.m**
  - Plots a 3D plane using various methods (point-normal form, general form, parametric form, and three points).

- **cylinder3D.m**
  - Plots a 3D cylinder, including circular, elliptical, and parabolic cylinders.

- **cones3D.m**
  - Plots 3D cones, both circular and elliptical.

- **sphere_elipsoid3D.m**
  - Plots 3D spheres and ellipsoids using standard equations.

- **hyperboloid3D.m**
  - Plots 3D hyperboloids of one sheet and two sheets.

- **paraboloids3D.m**
  - Plots 3D paraboloids, including elliptic and hyperbolic paraboloids.

- **surface_of_revolution3D.m**
  - Plots a 3D surface of revolution generated by revolving a function around an axis.

- **torus3D.m**
  - Plots a 3D torus with adjustable inner and outer radii.

- **mobius.m**
  - Plots a Möbius strip.

- **mobius_n.m**
  - Plots a generalized Möbius strip with `n` twists.

- **MobiusO.m**
  - Plots a Möbius strip with additional customization options.

- **figure8.m**
  - Plots a figure-eight knot.

## How to Use

1. **Select the Script:** Choose the MATLAB script corresponding to the surface you wish to plot.

2. **Edit Parameters:** Open the script in MATLAB and edit the parameters at the top to define your surface. The important parameters are clearly labeled and placed for easy access.

3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script in MATLAB. The 3D plot will be displayed in a new figure window.

## Examples

- **Plotting a Plane:**

  Open `plane3D.m`, select the method (e.g., `'point-normal'`), adjust the point `P0` and normal vector `n`, and run the script to visualize the plane.

- **Plotting a Surface of Revolution:**

  Open `surface_of_revolution3D.m`, define the function `f` to revolve, set the axis of revolution, and run the script to see the generated surface.

## Requirements

- MATLAB installed on your system.
- Basic familiarity with MATLAB scripting and editing.

## Notes

- All scripts are thoroughly commented for educational purposes.
- The plots are interactive; you can rotate and zoom to explore the surfaces.
- Feel free to modify and extend the scripts to suit your needs.
